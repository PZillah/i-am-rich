first iOS app evahhh

This app is inspired by a guy named Armin Heinrich who created an app with no function at all and charged $999.99. 
This was when apps first started coming out on the app store. It just displayed a single red ruby on the screen.
It was bought by 8 ppl and apple removed the app.
